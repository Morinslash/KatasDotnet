# Katas
If you add a new kata, create a new folder alongside `FizzBuzz/` with a `README.md` describing the exercise and add an entry to this index.

- [FizzBuzz](FizzBuzz/README.md) — classic introductory kata: print numbers 1..100 with substitutions for multiples of 3 and 5.
- [Leap Year](LeapYear/README.md) — determine whether a given year is a leap year using Gregorian rules.

Index of katas

- Each kata in this repo has a short description and, where appropriate, automated tests you can run.
- Katas are solved repeatedly to build muscle memory and to try different approaches (TDD, refactoring, performance, etc.).
- A kata is a short, repeatable exercise that helps you practice a specific skill or pattern.

What is a kata?

This repository contains a set of programming katas — small exercises used to practice and improve programming skills by solving focused problems and iterating on solutions.
